useraccounts:semantic-ui
========================

Meteor sign up and sign in templates styled for Semantic UI.

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core).

Learn more [here](http://useraccounts.meteor.com) or have a look at a [live demo application](http://useraccounts-semantic-ui.meteor.com/) or at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core).


## Bring Your Own Semantic-UI

Adding this package with `meteor add useraccounts:semantic-ui` does not add any other packages providing Semantic UI. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!

At the moment it is up to date with Semantic UI 2.0.7.
